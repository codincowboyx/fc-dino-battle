# Farcaster Frames Dino Battle App

A dino battle based on the farcaster frames api [Farcaster Frames](https://warpcast.notion.site/Farcaster-Frames-4bd47fe97dc74a42a48d3a234636d8c5). 


## Dev

1) make sure to create a @vercel/kv storage option for your project 
2) download the local .env file from vercel (should be a cmd line tool they provide to do that)
3) `vercel dev`

## Gotchas

* caching is a b**** for frames so always add the timestamp to the requests
